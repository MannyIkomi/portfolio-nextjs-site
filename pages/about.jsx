          My background in design comes from a combination of technical training
          and formal education, including printing, prepress, problem solving
          and concept development. Utilizing both these skillsets enables me to
          identify a problem and design a solution from start to finish.
          <br />
          With over 5 years of experience in the print industry I‚Äôve gained the
          skills and foresight required to take design ideas and develop them
          into a high quality product. In recent years, I‚Äôve been using code and
          the web as a creative medium to design unique and effective user
          interfaces.
